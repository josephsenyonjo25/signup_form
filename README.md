A CONTROLLED REACT COMPONENT SIGNUP FORM

The form has the user input fields:
UserName
Password
Age
Gender
Occupation

SignupForm component sets state and event handlers: handleChange and handleSubmit
The Display Component renders and displays the input.
I style the form with css: display flex.

When the user inputsinformation, it is displays below the form on submit.
